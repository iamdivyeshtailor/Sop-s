- Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team.

Docker Hub provides the following major features:

-   Repositories: Push and pull container images.
-   Teams & Organizations: Manage access to private repositories of container images.
-   Docker Official Images: Pull and use high-quality container images provided by Docker.
-   Docker Verified Publisher Images: Pull and use high- quality container images provided by external vendors.
-   Builds: Automatically build container images from GitHub and Bitbucket and push them to Docker Hub.
-   Webhooks: Trigger actions after a successful push to a repository to integrate Docker Hub with other services.

### Step 1: Sign up for a Docker account

Let’s start by creating a Docker ID.

A Docker ID grants you access to Docker Hub repositories and allows you to explore images that are available from the community and verified publishers. You’ll also need a Docker ID to share images on Docker Hub.

### Step 2: Create your first repository

To create a repository:

1.  Sign in to Docker Hub
2.  Click **Create a Repository** on the Docker Hub welcome page.
3.  Name it **<your-username>/my-private-repo**.
4.  Set the visibility to **Private**.

5.  Click Create.
    
    You’ve created your first repository. You should see:
    
    ![Repository Created](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/images/index-repo-created.png)
    

### Step 3: Download and install Docker Desktop

You’ll need to download Docker Desktop to build, push, and pull container images.

1.  Download and install Docker Desktop.
    
2.  Sign in to the Docker Desktop application using the Docker ID you’ve just created.
    

### Step 4: Pull and run a container image from Docker Hub

1.  Run `docker pull hello-world` to pull the image from Docker Hub. You should see output similar to:
    
    ```
    $ docker pull hello-world
    Using default tag: latest
    latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
    2db29710123e: Pull complete
    Digest:   sha256:7d246653d0511db2a6b2e0436cfd0e52ac8c066000264b3ce63331ac66dca625
    Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest
    docker.io/library/hello-world:latest
    ```
    
2.  Run `docker run hello-world` to run the image locally. You should see output similar to:
    
    ```
     $ docker run hello-world
     Hello from Docker!
     This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    
     To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
      1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
      2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
      (amd64)
      3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
      executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
      4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent
      it to your terminal.
    
     To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
      $ docker run -it ubuntu bash
    
     Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
      https://hub.docker.com/

### Step 5: Build and push a container image to Docker Hub from your computer[](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/#step-5-build-and-push-a-container-image-to-docker-hub-from-your-computer)

1.  Start by creating a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to specify your application as shown below:
    
    ```
    # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
    FROM busybox
    CMD echo "Hello world! This is my first Docker image."
    ```
    
2.  Run ```docker build -t <your_username>/my-private-repo .``` to build your Docker image.
    
3.  Run `docker run <your_username>/my-private-repo` to test your Docker image locally.
    
4.  Run `docker push <your_username>/my-private-repo` to push your Docker image to Docker Hub. You should see output similar to:
    
    ![Terminal](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/images/index-terminal.png)
    
    
5.  Your repository in Docker Hub should now display a new `latest` tag under **Tags**:
    
    ![Tag Created](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/images/index-tag.png)
    

Congratulations! You’ve successfully:

-   Signed up for a Docker account
-   Created your first repository
-   Pulled an existing container image from Docker Hub
-   Built your own container image on your computer
-   Pushed it successfully to Docker Hub
