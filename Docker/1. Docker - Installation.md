swp- sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io- Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to deploy and run application by using containers
- Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, Such as Libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.
- Now Docker will manage this container and ship it to another server.

This is where Docker come into USE.

![[Pasted image 20221018110520.png]]
- This is the arcitechture of how. Developer Develop a project
- So the developer will define all the application's and it's dependencies and requirement in file which is called as docker file.
- Now this docker file can be used to create a docker image 
- So in the docker image, you will have all the applicationa and its dependencie's and you run a  docker image. like this you get a docker container 
- So docker container are the run time instances odf a docker image
- And you can also store then on cloud. Where it is callled "Docker HUB"
- and in the Deployement phase. Docker come in to use

- This is how Docker will work in real life 

### Docker Engine
![[Pasted image 20221018114620.png]]
- Docker use the Concept of same as Virtualization. But with little bit of different concept called  "Containerization"
- Virtualization is use in VM. where it take a specific amount of Hardware resources like CPU, RAM and Space. So sometimes we dont need some resources. even then also VM will conzume it
- But this will solve in Docker. Docker will use only that much amount of resources which is requirement to run that code in a container
- and that is why there is a another layer in Docker called "Container engine". which will take care of all containers of Docker

### Docker Use a Client-Server Architecture

- Docker uses a client-server architecture. The Docker _client_ talks to the Docker _daemon_, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.
-  The Docker client and daemon _can_ run on the same system, or you can connect a Docker client to a remote Docker daemon.
- The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface.
- Another Docker client is Docker Compose, that lets you work with applications consisting of a set of containers.

- This is How Docker Works in Background

#### You can see how Docker and its container made step by step. in This Diagram

#### Advantages of using "Docker"

- An application inside a container can run on any system that has a docker installed in it. so there is no need to build and confiure app multiple times on different plateform
- ![[Pasted image 20221018121209.png]]
- with docker you test your application inside a container a container and ship it inside a container
- This means the enviroment in which you test is identical to the one on which the app will run in production.
-  it can run with multiple plateform like 
- ![[Pasted image 20221018121503.png]]
#### Version Control
- Like Git, Docker has a built version control system
- Docker container works just like GIT repositories, allowing you to commit changes to your Docker Images and version control them
- and every app works in its own container and does not interferes with other apps
-  With Docker every application works in isolation in its own container and does not interfaces with other applications running on the same system
- so multiple container can run on a same system without interferences
- and to removal you can simple delete the container and it will not leave behind and files or traces on the system

#### How to Install Docker in Linux

- Steps  
	- Connect to linux
	- Install Docker
	- Start Docker
	- Stop Docker
	- Uninstall Docker

- So First You need to connect to your Linux Machine.

1. check for update
```bash
sudo apt update
```

 2. using the following command To install Docker:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
```

After entering the above command, you will need to enter the password of the root and press enter.

3. Check if the system is up-to-date using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

4. Install Docker using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

You’ll then get a prompt asking you to choose between y/n - choose **_y_**

5. Install all the dependency packages using the following command:

```bash
sudo snap install docker
```

6. Before testing Docker, check the version installed using the following command:

```bash
docker --version
```

7. Pull an image from the Docker hub using the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

Here, **_hello-world_** is the docker image present on the Docker hub.

8. Check if the docker image has been pulled and is present in your system using the following command:

```bash
sudo docker images
```

9. To display all the containers pulled, use the following command:

```bash
sudo docker ps -a
```

10. To check for containers in a running state, use the following command:

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

### Then Install Docker CE

#### Step 1: Update System

Ensure your system is updated.

```
sudo apt -y update
```

### Step 2: Install basic dependencies

There are few dependencies we need to configure Docker repositories and do the actual package installation. Install them by firing the following commands in your terminal.

```
sudo apt -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
```

### Step 3: Install Docker CE

If you have older versions of Docker, remove it and its dependent packages.

```
sudo apt remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
```

Import Docker repository GPG key:

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

You can then add Docker CE repository to Ubuntu

```
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

Finally install Docker CE on Ubuntu22.04|20.04|18.04:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

Add your user account to docker group.

```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Verify installation by checking Docker version:

```
