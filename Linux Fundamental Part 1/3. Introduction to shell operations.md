## Operators

Linux operators are a fantastic way to power up your knowledge of working with Linux. There are a few important operators that are worth noting. We'll cover the basics and break them down accordingly to bite-sized chunks.

At an overview, I'm going to be showcasing the following operators: 

- &   

- This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.

```bash
ping 192.168.1.1 &


64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=21 ttl=64 time=0.688 ms

64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=22 ttl=64 time=0.717 ms

64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=23 ttl=64 time=0.661 ms

64 bytes from 192.168.1.1: icmp_seq=24 ttl=64 time=0.718 ms

```
 
-  &&   
 
 - This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y


Hit:1 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal InRelease

Hit:2 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-updates InRelease

Hit:3 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-backports InRelease

Hit:4 http://ports.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-ports focal-security InRelease

```
-  >

This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
```bash
echo password > password123


```
-  >>
This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).

```bash
echo password >> tryhackme

```
