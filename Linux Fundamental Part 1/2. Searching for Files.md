## Using Find & Grep Commands

---

Using find command

We can use find commandto do just this for us

```bash
Dvs:~ dvs$ Find divyesh.txt

divyesh.txt
```

---

if we need  to search for every file that has an extension such as ".txt". Find let's us do that too!


```bash
dvs:~$ find -name *.txt 

./folder1/passwords.txt
```

```bash
Dvs:~ dvs$ wc Downloads/linux/Test.php 

       0       0       0 Downloads/linux/Test.php
```
