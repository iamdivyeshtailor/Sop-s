For Protection Measures on Server-Site we are taking following measures

-> Key Based SSH Authentication.
-> UFW firewall to only allow http and https
-> open_basedir protection to limit php to access folder outside wordpress dir
-> ClamAV Antivirus.
-> Daily backups for whole servers.
-> Monitoring stack 
-> fail2ban to block ip with multiple failed attempts.

We can Guarantee Clients to provide 

1.  Upto 99.96% Uptime
2.  Daily Backups
3.  Easy Migration and Restoration
4. Site Isolation
5. Server hijacking Protection.

Note that the security of Wordpress is heavily reliant on the plugins and themes used.
