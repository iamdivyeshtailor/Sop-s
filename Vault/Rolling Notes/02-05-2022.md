Hello Ma'am, I Have scanned the site: wolfson.webcase.me with multiple tools like:

Virus-Total Report:  https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/3ed39d56f49ac8b13b9bedfa81da1c764d2f43c82515654d5539424de4992cc1

Google Safety Browsing: https://transparencyreport.google.com/safe-browsing/search?url=wolfson.webcase.me

According Virus-Total Report, 6 Antivirus vendors are flagging site as malware or phising. Following that I have scanned the site for malware/malicious code and have found nothing. 

I tired bit defender to findout why they are flagging the site but found no explanation. 

It's possible that our website was falsely flagged because I couldn't find any issues or malicious code.
