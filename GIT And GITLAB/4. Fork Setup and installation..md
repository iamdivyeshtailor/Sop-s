# **Members of a project** [**ALL TIERS**](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/?glm_source=docs.gitlab.com&glm_content=badges-docs)

Members are the users and groups who have access to your project.

Each member gets a role, which determines what they can do in the project.

**Project members can:**

1. Be [direct members](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#add-users-to-a-project) of the project.                                                                                                                                            

2. [Inherit membership](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/#inherited-membership) of the project from the project’s group.

3. Be a member of a group that was [shared](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/share_project_with_groups.html) with the project.

4.Be a member of a group that was [shared with the project’s group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/manage.html#share-a-group-with-another-group).

## **Add users to a project**

●       Add users to a project so they become members and have permission to perform actions. The Owner [role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#project-members-permissions) can only be added at the group level.

**Prerequisite:**

1.      On the top bar, select Menu > Projects and find your project.

                   2.  On the left sidebar, select Project information > Members.

           an email address, the uer receives an email.

           days later. Unaccepted invites are automatically deleted after 90 days.

●       If the user does not have a GitLab account, they are prompted to create an

           account using the email address the invitation was sent to.

When you add a group to a project, each user in the group gets access to the project. Each user’s access is based on:

●       The role they’re assigned in the group.
