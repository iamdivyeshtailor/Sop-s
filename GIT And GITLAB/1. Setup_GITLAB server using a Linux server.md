- ### How To Create a GITLAB Server Using a Linux Server
	- GitLab is a web-based open-source Git repository manager written in Ruby including wiki, issue management, code review, monitoring, and continuous integration and deployment. It enables developers to create, review, and deploy their projects.
	- There are three different editions of GitLab available, Community Edition (CE), Enterprise Edition (EE), and a GitLab-hosted version.

- #### Installation system requirements

	- ### Software requirements 
	- #### Hardware requirements
		#### Storage
		#### CPU
		#### Memory
		#### Database

- ### Software requirements 
	- GitLab 13.0 and later requires Redis version 5.0 or higher.

- #### Hardware requirements
	- ### Storage
		- GitLab package requires about 2.5 GB of storage space for installation.
		- Apart from a local hard drive you can also mount a volume that supports the network file system (NFS) protocol. This volume might be located on a file server, a network attached storage (NAS) device, a storage area network (SAN) or on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume.
		- If you have enough RAM and a recent CPU the speed of GitLab is mainly limited by hard drive seek times. Having a fast drive (7200 RPM and up) or a solid state drive (SSD) improves the responsiveness of GitLab.
	
	- #### CPU
		- CPU requirements are dependent on the number of users and expected workload.
		- The following is the recommended minimum CPU hardware guidance for a handful of example GitLab user base sizes.
		-   **4 cores** is the **recommended** minimum number of cores and supports up to 500 users
		-   8 cores supports up to 1000 users
	
	- #### Memory
		-   **4GB RAM** is the **required** minimum memory size and supports up to 500 users
	    -   Our Memory Team is working to reduce the memory requirement.
		-   8GB RAM supports up to 1000 users
		- In addition to the above, we generally recommend having at least 2GB of swap on your server, even if you currently have enough available RAM. Having swap helps to reduce the chance of errors occurring if your available memory changes. We also recommend configuring the kernel’s swappiness setting to a low value like 10 to make the most of your RAM while still having the swap available when needed.
	- #### Database
		- PostgreSQL is the only supported database, which is bundled with the Omnibus GitLab package. You can also use an external PostgreSQL database. Support for MySQL was removed in GitLab 12.1. Existing users using GitLab with MySQL/MariaDB are advised to migrate to PostgreSQL before upgrading.

- ### Installation and Support for Plateform
	- GITLAB works on 
		- Linux package:
			- Use if you want the most mature, scalable method. This version is also used on GitLab.com.
		- Helm chart:
			- Use if your infrastructure is on Kubernetes and you’re familiar with how it works. Management, observability, and some concepts are different than traditional deployments. 
		- Docker:
			- Use if you’re familiar with Docker. 
		- Source:
			-  Use if none of the previous methods are available for your platform. Can use for unsupported systems like *BSD.
		- GITlab enviromental Tools
		- GITlab operators:
			- Use to run GitLab in an OpenShift environment.
	
	- ### Cloud providers
		- You can install GitLab on several cloud providers.
		- AWS 
		- GCP
		- AZURE

- ### Unsupported operating systems
	-   Arch Linux
	-   Fedora
	-   FreeBSD
	-   Gentoo
	-   macOS
	-   Windows

# Installation

- ### Installing the Configuration and Necessary 
	- First you need to update your ubuntu Server
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates tzdata
```

![[Screen Shot 2022-10-04 at 9.18.07 AM.png]]
 
- and Now Select "no configuration"

- and then run this ommand to post fix
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y postfix
```


## Now add the GITLAB Package Repository

```bash
curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
```
- Now this will install Gitlab into this server. and we need to used this pulic or private DNS instead of "8.8.8.8" .
- and at last you can add the version also if you need a specific version. no it will take the latest version.

```bash
sudo EXTERNA_URL="https://redshift7.in" sudo apt-get install gitlab-ce
```

It looks like GitLab has not been configured yet; skipping the upgrade script.

 ```bash
       *.                  *.

      ***                 ***

     *****               *****

    .******             *******

Thank you for installing GitLab!

GitLab was unable to detect a valid hostname for your instance.
```

- Now GitLab is Install. so first start the Gitlab. By using this command 
- this take some time 
```bash
sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
```

- Once it will done. Now you can access Gitlab web interface by typing the public DNS into your browser.

# Configuration

- Then go to  etc/gitlab/
```bash
root@DIVS-BLR1-DEV:/etc/gitlab# 

gitlab-secrets.json  gitlab.rb  ssl  trusted-certs
```
- Open gitlab.rb file 
```bash
nano gitlab.rb
```

- Scroll down and in External URL write down your domoin
