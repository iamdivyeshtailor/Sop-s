  
To create a registry for Docker images in Bitbucket, you can use the built-in Docker Registry feature provided by Bitbucket. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Navigate to your Bitbucket repository in which you want to create the Docker registry.
    
2. Click on the "Settings" tab in the repository's menu.
    
3. In the left sidebar, under the "Pipelines" section, click on "Docker."
    
4. Toggle the switch to enable the Docker Registry feature.
    
5. Optionally, you can choose to restrict access to the Docker registry by enabling authentication. You can select one of the following options:
    
    - "Allow public access": Allows anyone with the image URL to pull the Docker image.
    - "Require authentication": Requires users to authenticate with their Bitbucket account to pull the Docker image.
    - "Restrict to specific users or groups": Allows you to define specific users or groups who can access the Docker registry.
6. Click on "Save settings" to create the Docker registry.
    

Once the Docker registry is created, you can push Docker images to it using the `docker push` command in your Bitbucket Pipeline configuration file (`bitbucket-pipelines.yml`), as shown in the previous example. Make sure to replace the placeholder `my-api-image` with the appropriate image name and tag that you want to push.

After pushing the image to the Bitbucket Docker registry, you can use it in your deployment steps or pull it on your server as needed.
