## Access Linux Machine using SSH

**Using SSH to Login to Your Linux Machine**

The syntax to use SSH is very simple. We only need to provide two things:
1. The IP address of the remote machine
2. Correct credentials to a valid account to login with on the remote machine


```
bash
ssh ubuntu@192.168.1.11
```
