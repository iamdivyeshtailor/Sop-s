## File interaction Commads


We covered some of the most fundamental commands when interacting with the filesystem on the Linux machine. For example, we covered how to list and find the contents of folders using `ls` and `find` and navigating the filesystem using `cd`. 

In this task, we're going to learn some more commands for interacting with the filesystem to allow us to:
-   create files and folders
-   move files and folders
-   delete files and folders
